We observed the field of the likely TYPE Fermi GRB XXXX  (trigger TRIGNUM, GCN #XXXX, Fermi GBM Team) with the DDOTI/OAN wide-field imager at the Observatorio Astron칩mico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro M치rtir ( http://ddoti.astroscu.unam.mx) on DATE from START to END UTC (STARTRIG to ENDTRIG after the event).

We observed a region of 20.4 degrees in RA by 20.4 degrees in declination, with a 3 x 2 grid, centered on the Fermi GBM MSGTYPE RA: RIGHTAS, DEC: DECLI (J2000 degrees). This region contains 6 instrumental fields or about 400 square degrees. We obtained MIN_exptime to MAX_exptime seconds of exposure per instrumental field in the w filter. We obtained AB photometry by calibration against the APASS catalog.

We detect no fading sources, likely candidates for the afterglow to our 10-sigma upper limits of w = MAGmin to MAGmax (inter-quartile).

We thank the staff of the Observatorio Astron칩mico Nacional in San Pedro M치rtir.
